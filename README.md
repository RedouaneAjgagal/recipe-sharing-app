# Recipe Sharing

Recipe sharing app is a full stack application

## Who made it and why

Im the one who is making this app and still going through it, almost done with the backend.

The main reason why i decided to make Recipe sharing app is to practice my MERN stack and gain more experience through complicated projects, so far i love the process

## Am i trying to build Recipe sharing app to become a successful app?

No. not at all, like i said before, my main plan is to learn and improve my full stack skills by implementing multiple features.
